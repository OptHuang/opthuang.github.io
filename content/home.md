I am a PhD student at [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), supervised by Dr. [Zaikun Zhang](https://www.zhangzk.net) and co-supervised Prof. [Xiaojun Chen](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/staff/xjchen/ChenXJ.htm).

## Research interests

My research interests mainly focus on [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) and its applications, especially

- [derivative-free optimization (DFO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization) (we made a Chinese popular science video about DFO and you can check it [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19N4y1U77E/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=a181d757948d784efb0cc0e55a618bd2)),
- randomized methods.
